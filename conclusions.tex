Summary of the work done:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is possible to continuously estimate the density of the crowd in a place of interest based on the Wi-Fi probe request frames.
  \item Designed and implemented a reliable system to do that.
  \item Tested the system in a Cafe and collected 4 weeks of data and manually-annotated ground truth with an overall MAE of 1.731.
\end{itemize}


\section{Future works}

Ideas for future works:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Real-Time execution.
  \item Test of the system in different contexts.
  \item Extension to multiple data collectors.
  \item Improvement of the machine learning model.
\end{itemize}
