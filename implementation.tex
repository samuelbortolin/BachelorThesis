This chapter presents how the system is implemented.
Starting by describing the implementation of the data collector on a Raspberry Pi and then explaining how the Mosquitto MQTT Broker, the MongoDB database and the two Back-End parts for storing and analyzing the data were implemented on the U-Hopper server. After this section, it will be clear how the system was implemented for the testing and validation, that are discussed in the next section.


\section{Data collector implementation}
\label{sec:collector}
\vspace{0.2 cm} 

Write how the sniffer has been implemented on the Raspberry Pi \dots

Raspberry pi model 2B

EDUP 802.11n Wi-Fi Dongle + Scapy for Wi-Fi packets sniffing

RTC Board for timestamp detection

Paho-MQTT per the MQTT transmission

Netifaces for managing the connection

BLAKE2s for MAC address anonymization

% Write how the broker MQTT has been implemented \dots


\section{Server implementation}
\label{sec:server}
\vspace{0.2 cm} 

Write how the Back-End for analysis has been implemented \dots

Docker Containers:

Mosquitto \footnote{ website: https://hub.docker.com/\_/eclipse-mosquitto }

MongoDB \footnote{ website: https://hub.docker.com/\_/mongo }

Receiver with MQTT client using paho-MQTT and pymongo for storing data on MongoDB

Analyzer uses pymongo and pandas to read and manage the data

Sklearn is used to analyze this data and implementing the machine learning part
