\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}
\vspace{0.4 cm} 

Write about the implementation of the system \dots

This chapter presents how the components of the system have been implemented.
Starting by describing the implementation of the data collector on a Raspberry Pi and then explaining how the Mosquitto MQTT Broker, the MongoDB database and the two Back-End parts, one for receiving and storing the data and the other one for analyzing the data, has been implemented on Docker containers. After this section, it will be clear how the system was implemented for the testing and validation, that are discussed in the next section.


\section{Data collector implementation}

Write how the sniffer has been implemented on the Raspberry Pi \dots

Data collector on a Raspberry Pi model 2B

EDUP 802.11n Wi-Fi Dongle (Range ~10 meters) + Scapy for Wi-Fi packets sniffing

RTC Board for timestamp detection

BLAKE2s for MAC address anonymization

Netifaces for managing the connection

Paho-MQTT for the MQTT transmission

\section{Server implementation}
\label{sec:server}
\vspace{0.2 cm} 

Write how the Back-End for analysis has been implemented \dots

Docker Containers:

MQTT broker: Mosquitto \footnote{ website: https://hub.docker.com/\_/eclipse-mosquitto }

Database: MongoDB \footnote{ website: https://hub.docker.com/\_/mongo }

Receiver with MQTT client using paho-MQTT for receiving the data and Mongo client using pymongo for storing data on MongoDB

Analyzer with Mongo client using pymongo and pandas to read and manage the data

Sklearn is used to analyze this data and to implement the machine learning part
