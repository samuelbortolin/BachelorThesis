\label{cha:system}
\vspace{0.4 cm} 

In this chapter, the methodology and the choices in the system design are presented. Starting by describing the components of the system with their functionalities (i.e. the blocks in the system architecture) and then explaining the working logic of the developed system. After this chapter, it will be clear which are the main parts of this system and how they cooperate to achieve the project goal.


\section{System architecture}
\label{sec:sysarc}
\vspace{0.2 cm} 

In a place of interest, there are people/users with their devices that are sending Wi-Fi packets, if they have the Wi-Fi device turned on. The purpose of our system is to exploit these packets to infer the number of people present. The system architecture of the developed system is shown in figure~\ref{fig:architecture}.
This is a distributed architecture, in fact, there are three main components on different platforms that cooperate over a communication network in order to achieve this goal.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/architecture} 
\caption{Architecture of the proposed system.}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The first block of the system is a data collector which is located in the place of interest. It performs a preprocessing of the data (distributed work) with its functionalities: sniffing of Wi-Fi packets, capture the probe request frames; extract the useful information from these; detect the current timestamp; anonymize the MAC address using a hash function (no more privacy issues); check the internet connection; if there is no connection, save the data in the local storage; if there is a connection, publish the collected data to the dedicated queue.

The system uses the MQTT protocol for data forwarding, using an MQTT broker situated on a server, it must have a static IP address to be accessible, the broker has two dedicated queues: one for the collected data, published by the data collector and received by the subscribed receiver in the Back-End part, and the other one for the Back-End results published by the Back-End part after the analysis and received by the subscribed consumer.

The Back-End part is situated on a server. Initially, it deals with collected data receiving and storing in a database. Then, it deals with data cleaning: RSSI thresholding, remove random encounters (and randomized MAC addresses are removed with this), make a blacklist to remove the ever-present devices or devices revealed too many times during the day and therefore get the number of devices present in the place of interest. Finally, it deals with data analysis using Machine Learning: fit the degree and the coefficients of the polynomial approximation using the trend and the seasonality of the number of devices detected to get the number of people present and publication of the results to the dedicated queue.

At the end of this processing, there is the consumer who receives the results of the Back-End, i.e. the number of people in the place of interest, and could use this information to improve his business.

This architecture is scalable, it could admit many sensors physically distributed in different environments for data collection, to provide a practical example some use cases are shown in figure~\ref{fig:excases}. It is important to locate them properly in the environments to cover all the areas of interest. All sensors publish data to the same MQTT broker and then all data is forwarded to the same Back-End. Cleaning and analysis will be performed according to the data source, each sensor will publish data in its own reserved queue and will be analyzed adequately to the characteristics of the use case for which it was used. In the end, results are sent to the respective consumer through an appropriate queue.

\section{Data collection}
\label{sec:collection}
\vspace{0.2 cm} 

The main block I worked on is the data collector. I developed the logic behind this block, with particular attention in the research of the connection and in the management of the data collected.

The flowchart representing the data collector logic is shown in figure~\ref{fig:flowcollect}. When the data collector is turned on, the system searches for the connected Wi-Fi dongle and puts it in monitor mode to perform the packet sniffing. Initially, a packet counter is set = 0 and the actual timestamp is saved. When a packet is received, it checks if it is a probe request frame and if it is not, it is thrown away.
When a probe request frame is captured, the following information are extracted: RSSI, SSID (Service Set Identifier), MAC address, sequence counter. The timestamp when the packet was revealed together with the other information are saved and the packet counter increases by one.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/flowcollect} 
\caption{Flowchart representing the data collector logic.}
\label{fig:flowcollect}
\end{figure}

% \begin{wrapfloat}{figure}{I}{0pt} 
% \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/flowcollect}
% \caption{Flowchart representing the data collector logic.}
% \label{fig:flowcollect}
% \end{wrapfloat}

Among the information that can be extracted from the MAC address before performing the anonymization there are the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), from which the manufacturer of the device can be identified, and the local bit, the 7\textsuperscript{th} bit of the MAC address, from which it can be seen whether the MAC address is randomized or not.

After extracting the information, there is the anonymization of the MAC address to preserve the privacy of the users and comply with the GDPR. This is made only for the MAC addresses that are not randomized, i.e. the real MAC addresses of the devices present. Anonymization is performed at this point in the architecture because then there are no more privacy problems, this work does not have to be done from the Back-End and for reasons of data security in case of a data breach during transmission.
This process consists of hashing the MAC address using the BLAKE2 cryptographic hash function\footnote{ website: \url{https://blake2.net/} } (BLAKE3 is faster but still under development). BLAKE2 is faster than MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2 and SHA-3, and provides security superior to SHA-2 and similar to that of SHA-3. BLAKE2 supports keying and salting, and can output digests from 1 up to 32 or 64 bytes depending on the version. This hash function is the ideal for changing hash results every 24 hours or predefined time, simply modifying the key or adding a different value of salt. This is made for privacy reasons and to avoid tracing the MAC address although it is not the real one but always the same after hashing.
If the anonymization changes the state of the local bit, the previous state is forced/imposed to preserve this information on randomization, which can be used in the cleaning phase.

Once the pre-processing of the data is completed, we decided to process the collected data in batches and therefore there are to check 2 batch criteria, based on a maximum number of packets and a maximum time since the last batch transmission. These parameters have to be set according to the use case/case study, once one of these is reached it is possible to decide what to do with this data by running the data management flowchart, shown in figure~\ref{fig:flowdata}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/flowdata} 
\caption{Flowchart representing the data management logic.}
\label{fig:flowdata}
\end{figure}

Higher values of the parameters allow us to avoid a continuous transmission of data and to fill the queue on the broker or in the lack of a connection, to open the file to save the data every time a packet is detected. On the other hand, choosing smaller values of the parameters reduces estimation delay, making the system more responsive. In our experiments, we used intermediate values with a maximum number of packets of 50 and a maximum time since the last batch transmission of 60 seconds, which is a good trade-off between congestion and transmission delay.

When the batch is ready, the algorithm for managing what to do with the data starts. If there is no connection, the collected data is stored locally to be sent later when a connection is found.
Instead, if there is a connection with the MQTT broker, the collected data is published to the dedicated queue. If the publication is successful, the flowchart ends. Otherwise, it is stored locally, subsequently the system searches again for a connection.

% \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/flowconnection} 
% \caption{Flowchart representing the connection research logic.}
% \label{fig:flowconnection}
% \end{figure}

When the data collector is turned on, the system searches also for a connection with the MQTT broker. Figure~\ref{fig:flowconnection} shows the flowchart explaining the logic behind this. Initially, the connection is set = False and the system checks whether the data collector has a peripheral with an IP address for Internet access.
When it has an IP address, a MQTT Client with its credentials tries connecting to the MQTT broker. When the broker is reachable and accepts the client connection, the connection is set = True and if there is data stored locally, it can be published by running the flowchart for the publication of the stored data, shown in figure~\ref{fig:flowstorage}.

% \begin{figure}[h]
% \centering 
% \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/flowstorage} 
% \caption{Flowchart representing the stored data publishing logic.}
% \label{fig:flowstorage}
% \end{figure}

The data is read from the local storage and is published to the dedicated queue. If the publication is successful, the data is deleted from the local storage. Otherwise, it remains stored locally and the system searches again for a connection.


\section{Data forwarding}
\label{sec:forwarding}
\vspace{0.2 cm} 

MQTT\footnote{ website: \url{http://mqtt.org/} } stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol. It is designed to be bandwidth-efficient and to use little battery power. It is efficient in distributing information to one or many receivers. Information is organized in topics. Topics are treated as a hierarchy, using a slash (/) as a separator. These principles make it the ideal protocol for the emerging world of machine-to-machine/Internet of Things and for mobile applications where bandwidth and battery power are limited. It is useful for connections with remote locations, as in our case to send a huge amount of data to the Back-End part. Moreover, it can easily scale from a single device to thousands.

The MQTT protocol defines two types of network entities: a message broker and clients. An MQTT broker is a software running on a computer that receives all messages from the clients and then routes them to the appropriate destination clients. An MQTT client is any device that runs an MQTT library and connects to an MQTT broker over a network.
For security reasons, the MQTT broker can be configured to require clients to use a username and password when connecting. If they match allowed credentials, clients can publish/subscribe to the topics. Otherwise, the connection is refused.
When a publisher has new data to distribute, it publishes this data to the broker. Any client that wants a copy of that message will subscribe to that topic. The broker then distributes the data to any clients that have subscribed to that topic. Multiple clients can receive the message from a single broker. Similarly, multiple publishers can publish topics to a single subscriber.

The protocol uses a publish/subscribe architecture in contrast to HTTP with its request/response paradigm. The main difference to HTTP is that a client does not have to pull the information it needs, but the broker pushes the information to the subscribed client, in case something new has been published. The broker also keeps track of all session information as clients connect and disconnect. If this connection is interrupted by any circumstances, the MQTT broker can buffer all messages and send them to the client when it is back online, setting the clean session bit = False. If clean session bit is true, then all subscriptions will be removed for the client when it disconnects.

Each subscription/publication to the broker can specify a quality of service measure. These are classified in increasing order of overheads:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 0: At most once - the message is sent only once and the publisher and broker take no additional steps to acknowledge delivery to the subscribers (fire and forget, with no confirmation).
  \item 1: At least once - the message is re-tried by the sender (publisher or broker) multiple times until acknowledgment is received (by the broker or the subscribers) (acknowledged delivery).
  \item 2: Exactly once - the sender (publisher or broker) and receiver (broker or the subscribers) engage in a two-level handshake to ensure only one copy of the message is received (assured delivery).
\end{itemize}

For these illustrated features, the MQTT protocol is used in the system for data forwarding. A broker situated on a server, with a static IP address to be accessible and with two dedicated queues is used, one for the collected data, published by the data collector and received by the subscribed Back-End part, and the other one for the Back-End results published by the Back-End and received by the subscribed consumer.
The broker is set up to allow only connections from the data collector, the Back-End and the consumer. They have their own credentials for authentication.

The clean\_session is set = False. If this connection is interrupted by any circumstances, the MQTT broker can buffer all messages and send them to the client when it is back online.
The QoS is set = 2 both in publish and subscribe. To ensure exactly one copy of the data, no loss, no duplicates to clean.


\section{Data cleaning and analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}
\vspace{0.2 cm} 

The Back-End part is situated on a server and receives and stores the collected data. The two main Back-End functionalities are data cleaning and data analysis.

The flowchart representing the data Back-End logic is shown in figure~\ref{fig:flowcleaner}. Initially, the Back-End subscribes to the collected data queue to receive the data when published by the data collector. Input data is managed by adding corollary information for future analysis, e.g. randomization and day of the week. Then this data is stored in a database.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{images/flowcleaner} 
\caption{Flowchart representing the Back-End and the cleaning logic.}
\label{fig:flowcleaner}
\end{figure}

When a time slot is over, the data of the current time slot is read from the database. An RSSI-based threshold is applied to delete data from devices too far from the data collector (to be adapted to the case study, the position of the data collector has to be taken into consideration, as well the environment in which they are located, for cleaning and analysis). Random encounters are removed, as shown in the flowchart in figure~\ref{fig:flowrandom}. Unique devices are extracted with their occurrence timestamps. If there are devices that appear only once or for a short time, they are removed. These parameters have to be adapted to the case study (and randomized addresses are removed with this).

% \begin{figure}[h]
% \centering 
% \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/flowrandom} 
% \caption{Flowchart representing the logic of removing casual encounters.}
% \label{fig:flowrandom}
% \end{figure}

Then a blacklist is made to remove the ever-present devices or devices revealed too many times during the day, as shown in the flowchart in figure~\ref{fig:flowblacklist}. A list of occurrences is created with a maximum interrupt time of delta\_t. If there are devices that appears many times or for a long time, they are blacklisted. These parameters have to be adapted to the case study.
At this point, it is possible to get the number of devices present in the place of interest for each timestamp based on the occurrences of the devices not in the blacklist.

% \begin{figure}[h]
% \centering 
% \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/flowblacklist} 
% \caption{Flowchart representing the logic of making the blacklist.}
% \label{fig:flowblacklist}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{images/flowblacklist}
\caption{Flowchart representing the logic of making the blacklist.}
\label{fig:flowblacklist}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Finally, data analysis is performed, as shown in the flowchart in figure~\ref{fig:flowML}. Trend (raising/lowering) and seasonality (repetition of the components) of the number of devices are extracted using a decomposition of the corresponding temporal series. Once these two variables are known, it is possible to apply to them the correct polynomial approximation relating to the current time slot to get the forecast of the people present in the place of interest.

\end{figure}

I did not develop the part of machine learning, but I integrated an existing one into this project to get the final results, i.e. the number of people in the place of interest for each timestamp. Then the results, when available, are published to the dedicated queue (Back-End results) to be received by the subscribed consumer who could use this information to improve his business.


\subsection{Preparation of the model}
\label{sec:model}
\vspace{0.2 cm} 

The best degree and coefficients of the polynomial approximation are calculated during the training phase/preparation of the model for each time slot of each day of the week, using manually-collected ground truth. Figure~\ref{fig:flowtrainML} shows the flowchart of the logic used in that phase.

In the timestamps where the ground truth is collected by the number of devices revealed in these timestamps, we get the trend and the seasonality of the annotated dataset.
Using this dataset we train a regressor to find the best polynomial approximation for each considered time slot. We initially divide the dataset into train set and test set. The Machine Learning model performs a trend analysis to find the best polynomial approximation for each time slot. These values of the coefficients are stored to be used in the different time slots when data are collected to get the correct estimate of the number of people.

The management of the different time processes is shown in figure~\ref{fig:presenceMAC} and~\ref{fig:GTprocess}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Probe revelations from the data collector: a random point process with different MAC addresses.
  \item Presence of devices: a cadlag step function based on the revelations of the MAC addresses, obtained after the cleaning of the collected data.
  \item Collection of the ground truth: a sampling of the number people present, a random point process asynchronous with respect to the probe revealed and devices revealed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/presenceMAC} 
\caption{Illustration of the collection of the ground truth.}
\label{fig:presenceMAC}
\end{figure}

Step function for the presence of the different MAC addresses:

presence MAC$_1$ $= 1 \cdot \chi_{[ t_{0} - t_{p}, t_{3} + t_{p} )} + 1 \cdot \chi_{[ t_{6} - t_{p}, t_{9} + t_{p} )}$

presence of devices $= \sum_i$ precence MAC$_i$

\label{fig:GTprocess}
\end{figure}

Dirac delta function for sampling the number of people presence:

GT(t$_i$) $= g(t) \cdot \delta(t - t_{i})$
